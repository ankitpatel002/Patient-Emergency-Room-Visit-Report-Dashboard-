Patient Emergency Room Visit Report Dashboard â€“ Power BI
I designed this interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze emergency room (ER) visits, providing key insights into patient demographics, visit patterns, satisfaction levels, and referrals. The dashboard is structured to help hospital administrators and healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions to enhance patient care.

-> Key Metrics & KPIs:
1. Total Patient Visits: 9,216 (Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments)
2. Avg Satisfaction Score: 5.47
3. Service Not Rated: 75.10%
4. Avg Wait Time: 35.26 mins
5. Referral Percentage: 41.41% Referred vs. 58.59% Unreferred Patients

-> Visual Insights:
-> Visit Trends:
1. By Year: ER visits increased from 4,338 in 2019 to 4,878 in 2020.
2. By Week Type: Majority of visits occur on Weekdays (6,574) compared to Weekends (2,642).
3. By Age Group: Adults (7,106 visits) have the highest ER visits, followed by Middle Childhood, Teenagers, and Infants.
4. By Referral Department: Most referrals are from General Practice (1,840), followed by Orthopedics, Physiotherapy, and Cardiology.

1. Gender Breakdown: Male (51.1%), Female (48.7%), Unknown (0.26%)
2. Patient Race Distribution: Heatmap analysis highlights satisfaction levels across different age groups and racial backgrounds.

1. Patients are most satisfied when wait times are lowest (highlighted in the heatmap).
2. The satisfaction scale shows the darkest green on the age groups with the best experience.

This dashboard provides valuable real-time insights for hospital management, ER staff, and policymakers to improve efficiency, reduce wait times, and enhance patient satisfaction.
